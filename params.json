{"name":"Ambienators","tagline":"Smart Ambient Sensor System for NUS Orbital 2014 project","body":"**1. Ideation**\r\n\r\nThe SmartAmbient sensor system is an orbital project planned for the Gemini level. It can be used by the managers of workplaces, schools and offices to monitor the usage of utilities such as air conditioning and lighting. It can also serve as a security feature, by monitoring motion in the vicinity. Leaving the lights and air-conditioner wastes electricity as well as money. With this app, the users can get real-time data and alerts based on customised settings (such as when the temperature is below a certain value).\r\n \r\nSensor components will include\r\n* Temperature Sensor Module\r\n* Light Sensor Module\r\n* Motion Sensor Module\r\n \r\n**2. Planned features**\r\n\r\nHardware Design\r\nWe plan to integrate these components together into a single integrated unit which the user can purchase and install on the ceiling or wall of a room.\r\n* Arduino Uno Unit\r\n*  Temperature Sensor Module\r\n*  Light Sensor Module\r\n*  Motion Sensor Module\r\n*  Ethernet Module\r\n*  Wifi Module\r\nWe plan to enable this single integrated unit to connect to the internet, either by using a wired LAN connection, or wifi. The unit will communicate with the Google cloud server, and store ambient statuses onto the cloud, which are accessible to the end-user through a google webapp which we plan to develop. We plan to have at least one ambient sensor working by Milestone 2, and all three ambient sensors working by Milestone 3.\r\n \r\n**Software Design**\r\n\r\nWe plan to develope a Google WebApp which allows the end-user to:\r\nView the instantaneous statuses of the three main sensor modules. Statuses include temperature in degrees Celsius, light intensity in lumens, Boolean presence of motion. (We plan to complete this by Milestone 2)  \r\nView the history of the statuses of the three main sensor modules (We plan to complete this by Milestone 3)\r\nAllow end-users to preconfigure situations to be alerted. Eg: if temperature goes below 27â€™C, send me a notification. If motion is detected, send me a notification (We plan to complete this by Milestone 3)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
